# Real-State-Price-Prediction
A detailed breakdown of the factors which affect property price and predicting the price of property for various purposes.

Welcome to the Bengaluru_House_Data dataset contains details of residential properties in Bengaluru, India. It includes attributes like the area_type, location, availability, size, society, total_sqft, bath, balcony and price across different localities in the city. This comprehensive housing data provides valuable insights into the Bengaluru real estate market. We will delve into the data to extract insights, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and draw meaningful conclusions and train our model to predict prices.

This project focuses on developing a robust machine learning model to predict real estate property prices based on various input features. Accurate prediction of housing prices is crucial for buyers, sellers, investors, and real estate professionals to make informed decisions. Using a dataset this notebook walks through the full data science pipeline â€” from data cleaning and exploration to model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

The dataset used in this project contains key features that influence real estate prices, such as the location of the property, the total square footage, the number of bathrooms (`bath`), the number of bedrooms (`size`), and the target variable, `price`, which is expressed in lakhs. The data is either sourced from a real estate aggregator or a public repository such as Kaggle. A notable challenge with this dataset is the high variability in location and inconsistent formatting of numerical features, which required significant preprocessing and standardization.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) played a vital role in understanding the relationships between variables. Visualizations were employed to identify trends in property prices based on location and size. We used histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to explore outliers and assess the distribution of features like price per square foot. One key insight was that price per square foot varies greatly between locations, making it a strong candidate for a derived feature. Outliers were also handled carefully using domain knowledge, such as filtering out properties with unusually high price-to-size ratios or inconsistent bedroom-to-bathroom combinations.

In the data cleaning and feature engineering phase, we standardized the format of the square footage values, removed records with missing or anomalous values, and converted categorical features like `location` using one-hot encoding. To reduce dimensionality and noise, rarely occurring locations were grouped under a generic label like "other". Additionally, we engineered new features such as `price_per_sqft`, which provided a more consistent metric for comparing properties across different areas.

Several regression models were trained to predict the price of properties. We started with a baseline linear regression model, followed by more advanced algorithms like Lasso Regression for feature selection and tree-based models like Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressors. Among these, the Random Forest model delivered the best performance, balancing accuracy and generalization. We performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to identify the optimal model configuration.

This project is built using Python and Jupyter Notebook, leveraging libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks. Optionally, Joblib can be used to serialize the trained model for deployment or reuse.

To run this project, clone the repository and ensure you have all dependencies installed. Then open the notebook file `real-estate-price-prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter and run all cells. The project also lends itself well to future expansion. For instance, the model can be deployed as a web application using Flask or Streamlit, allowing users to input features and receive real-time price predictions. There is also potential to enhance the model by integrating geospatial coordinates (latitude and longitude) or using ensemble and deep learning techniques to further boost accuracy.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates a practical approach to predicting property prices with real-world data. It combines data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning to yield meaningful predictions that can guide decision-making in the real estate sector.
